# rc-finder
This Python script creates a Discord bot that allows users to query the Indian vehicle registration database by providing the RC number. The bot sends an HTTP request to the RapidAPI service to retrieve the details of the vehicle and saves the response to a JSON file. The script then uploads the file to the Discord server for users to access.
